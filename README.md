## üíª About the project

CareBridge is a web application designed to facilitate appointment scheduling between patients and doctors in Ontario. Patients can search for doctors by specialty and location, while doctors can manage their schedules and patient appointments. The system also supports assistants who can manage doctors' agendas but only for their assigned doctors.
